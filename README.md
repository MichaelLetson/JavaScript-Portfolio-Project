## For my Milestone Project 2 I decided to create a simple Noughts & Crosses game, that two people can play. 

The game can be play on either desktop, tablet or mobile screens. Visit the webpage here: https://michaelletson.github.io/JavaScript-Portfolio-Project/ 

## Who is the website for and it's purpose?

The webpage is for two people looking to play a simple game of Noughts and Crosses. It is not a complicated game, therefore the webpage should be clutter free and enable the user to play with ease, and be able to play immediately. 

## User stories 

- To play a game of multi player noughts and crosses with ease. 
- Simply be able to use/nagivate the webpage. 
- To know who (player X or O) has won. 

## Fullfillment 

- Simple layout with message to state the game is multi-player.
- A layout free of clutter to not distract the user from it's simplicity.
- Only allow simple functions, of resetting the game. 

## Owner and improvements

- The game own/designer could explore a option of playing against the computer. 
- The game own/designer could also explore the option of having a difficulty range for the computer player option. 
- The game could also include some more visuals, such as animations upon tile selection, and announcing the winner. 

## Testing
- Website tested on Chrome, Edge, Samsung internet. 
- Moblie, Tablet and Laptop have all tested the website with no visual errors and maintains functionality.
- Used Chrome Dev Tool to test site, including when testing styling for media queries and also looking at JavaScript code to ensure efficiency and look for errors.
- The game was stress tested manually.
- Console logs were carried out to ensure the code was efficiently running (checked in dev tools).

## HTML Validator 

The HTML code bounced just one error which was a stray </header> element which was removed, the only result now is some warnings which can be overlooked as thsoe elements, should they not result with errors, are needed for CSS styling and JavaScript functionality.
