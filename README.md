# For my Milestone Project 2 I decided to create a simple Noughts & Crosses game, that two people can play. 

The game can be play on either desktop, tablet or mobile screens. Visit the webpage here: https://michaelletson.github.io/JavaScript-Portfolio-Project/ 

## Who is the website for and it's purpose?

The webpage is for two people looking to play a simple game of Noughts and Crosses. It is not a complicated game, therefore the webpage should be clutter free and enable to user to play with ease, and be able to play immediately.
