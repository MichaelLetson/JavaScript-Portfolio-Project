## For my Milestone Project 2 I decided to create a simple Noughts & Crosses game, that two people can play. 

The game can be play on either desktop, tablet or mobile screens. Visit the webpage here: https://michaelletson.github.io/JavaScript-Portfolio-Project/ 

## Who is the website for and it's purpose?

The webpage is for two people looking to play a simple game of Noughts and Crosses. It is not a complicated game, therefore the webpage should be clutter free and enable the user to play with ease, and be able to play immediately. 

## User stories 

-To play a game of multi player noughts and crosses with ease. 
-Simply be able to use/nagivate the webpage. 
-To know who (player X or O) has won. 

## Fullfillment 

-Simple layout with message to state the game is multi-player.
-A layout free of clutter to not distract the user from it's simplicity.
-Only allow simple functions, of resetting the game.
